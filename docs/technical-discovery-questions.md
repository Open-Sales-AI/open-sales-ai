Here is a list of **technical discovery questions** that a Solution Architect can ask to guide discussions and evaluate if **Kubeflow** is the best solution for an AI/ML Ops platform:

---

### **General AI/ML Requirements**
1. **Current Use Cases:**
   - What are the primary AI/ML use cases or workflows you are currently supporting?
   - How complex are your models (e.g., deep learning, reinforcement learning, traditional ML)?
2. **Team Dynamics:**
   - What is the structure of your data science and ML engineering teams? 
   - Do you need collaboration tools for distributed teams?

---

### **Model Development**
3. **Tools and Frameworks:**
   - What ML frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn) are your teams using?
   - Do you currently use Jupyter notebooks, and how are they managed?
4. **Version Control:**
   - How do you version control datasets, models, and code?
5. **Experimentation:**
   - How do you track and manage experiments, including hyperparameters and metrics?

---

### **Model Training**
6. **Infrastructure:**
   - What infrastructure are you using for model training (on-premise, cloud, hybrid)?
   - Do you use GPUs or specialized hardware, and what are your scaling requirements?
7. **Parallel Training:**
   - Are you running distributed training, and if so, which orchestration tools do you use?
8. **Pipeline Automation:**
   - Are you building automated training pipelines? If so, what tools or workflows are in place?

---

### **Model Deployment**
9. **Deployment Environment:**
   - How do you deploy models today (batch, online, streaming)?
   - Are you deploying to edge devices, cloud, or on-prem environments?
10. **Monitoring and Updates:**
    - How do you monitor deployed models for performance and drift?
    - What is your process for updating models in production?

---

### **Data Management**
11. **Data Sources:**
    - What are your primary data sources, and how are they accessed?
    - Are you working with structured, unstructured, or real-time data?
12. **Data Pipelines:**
    - How are data pipelines managed, and what tools are you using for ETL/ELT workflows?

---

### **Scalability and Reliability**
13. **Scale:**
    - How many models are in production today, and how do you plan to scale?
14. **Availability:**
    - What are your uptime and reliability requirements for ML operations?

---

### **Integration**
15. **Existing Tools:**
    - What tools and platforms are already in use for ML Ops (e.g., SageMaker, Databricks, Airflow)?
    - Do you need Kubeflow to integrate with CI/CD pipelines, databases, or APIs?
16. **Interoperability:**
    - Do you have requirements for using Kubernetes or other container orchestration systems?

---

### **Governance and Compliance**
17. **Auditability:**
    - How important are reproducibility and auditability in your ML workflows?
18. **Security:**
    - What are your data security and access control requirements?
19. **Compliance:**
    - Do you need to adhere to specific regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)?

---

### **Cost and ROI**
20. **Cost Considerations:**
    - What is your current cost structure for ML infrastructure?
    - Are you looking to optimize costs, and how do you measure ROI for ML platforms?

---

### **Technical Gaps**
21. **Pain Points:**
    - What are the major challenges or inefficiencies in your current ML Ops workflows?
    - Are you facing issues with tooling fragmentation or scalability?

---

### **Success Criteria**
22. **Goals:**
    - What does a successful ML Ops platform look like for your team?
23. **KPIs:**
    - What key performance indicators (KPIs) will you use to measure the success of this platform?

---

By addressing these questions, you can determine whether Kubeflow’s capabilities—such as pipeline automation, scalability with Kubernetes, and open-source flexibility—align with the customer’s technical needs and goals.
