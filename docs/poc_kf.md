#### Success Criteria
- Training pipelines executed using **TFJob** or **PyTorchJob** for small, medium, and large models.
- GPU utilization reaches at least 85% efficiency during training.
- Distributed training scales linearly with workload size (using Horovod or similar frameworks).

---

### 3. Model Serving
#### Use Case
Deploy trained models for real-time or batch inference using KFServing (KServe) with autoscaling capabilities.

#### Success Criteria

- Latency for real-time inference remains under **200 ms** for 95% of requests.
- Batch inference scales to process **10,000 requests/hour** with minimal downtime.

---

### 4. Model Metrics and Monitoring
#### Use Case
Monitor metrics for model training and inference, and visualize them on Grafana dashboards.

#### Success Criteria
- Training metrics logged and visualized in **TensorBoard** or **Grafana**.
- Real-time inference metrics captured and monitored using **Prometheus**.
- Alerts configured for anomalies in resource utilization or model drift.

---

### 5. Model Monitoring
#### Use Case
Detect model drift, data drift, and anomalies in deployed models.

#### Success Criteria
- Drift detection implemented using tools like **Evidently** or **Alibi Detect**.
- Logs of prediction errors stored and analyzed.
- Alerts triggered for performance degradation or anomaly thresholds.

---

### 6. Performance Testing
#### Use Case
Evaluate Kubeflow's performance under varying workloads and resource configurations.

#### Success Criteria
- Stress tests simulate **100,000 requests/day** for inference endpoints without failure.
- Performance benchmarks recorded for:
  - Training speed (models/hour).
  - Serving latency (ms/request).
  - Cluster resource utilization (% CPU, memory, GPU).

---

### 7. Networking
#### Use Case
Ensure secure and efficient communication between components, including ingress/egress and internal connectivity.

#### Success Criteria
- **Ingress**:
  - Expose endpoints via Istio Gateway or NGINX Ingress Controller with HTTPS enabled.
  - Validate performance under a **1,000 RPS (Requests Per Second)** load.
- **Egress**:
  - Secure access to external storage services (e.g., S3, Azure Blob Storage).
  - Restrict unauthorized outbound traffic using Kubernetes Network Policies.
- **Internal Networking**:
  - Validate pod-to-pod communication for distributed training.
  - Ensure DNS resolution for services within the cluster.
- **Latency**:
  - End-to-end latency for requests remains below **100 ms** within the cluster.
- **Security**:
  - Enable Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and TLS for all endpoints.

- Enable TLS for all ingress traffic to protect data in transit.
- Configure load balancers (e.g., AWS ALB, Azure Load Balancer) for high availability.

### 2. Egress
